1. Python (Programming Language):
You need to install Python itself to run the script. You can download it from python.org. Make sure you're using Python 3.x.
2. Standard Libraries (Included with Python):
These libraries are included with Python by default, so you don’t need to install them separately:

tkinter: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
subprocess: To execute system commands like ping, traceroute, etc.
socket: For network-related operations (e.g., IP address resolution).
re: For regular expressions (used for validating domain names).
platform: For detecting the operating system.
time: For timestamps and delays.
ipaddress: For IP address validation.
3. External Libraries (Need to Install Separately):
These libraries are not included with Python and will need to be installed using pip (Python's package manager). You’ll need to run the following command to install them.

requests: Used for making HTTP requests (for geolocation, HTTP header retrieval, etc.).

Install: pip install requests
shodan: For looking up Shodan information (open ports, vulnerabilities).

Install: pip install shodan
python-whois: To perform WHOIS lookups on domain names.

Install: pip install python-whois
dnspython: For DNS record retrieval.

Install: pip install dnspython
pyfiglet: For generating ASCII art text banners (optional).

Install: pip install pyfiglet
matplotlib: For plotting latency results (optional).

Install: pip install matplotlib
tkinter: While it’s included with most Python installations, you may need to install it separately on some Linux distributions.

Install on Linux (if needed): sudo apt-get install python3-tk

pip install python-whois
